Getting Started

This guide will walk you through setting up and running the project.

1. Prerequisites

Python 3 (Download from https://www.python.org/downloads/)
pip (usually comes bundled with Python)

2. Project Setup

Extract the downloaded project files.
Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the extracted folder named "J&J_Project".

3. Install Dependencies

We'll use pip to install the required library: Flask.

In your terminal, run the following command:

--> pip install Flask

4. Run the Application

In the terminal, navigate back to the "J&J_Project" folder (if you've exited).
Run the following command to start the Flask app:

--> python app.py

5. Access the Warehouse Interface

Open a web browser.
Visit http://localhost:5000 in the address bar.(Also direct via terminal just by Ctrl+click on the local host link)

This will display the warehouse layout with the shortest path highlighted.

6. Interact and Experiment!

Feel free to explore the warehouse layout displayed on the web page. The code resides in the main.py file. To experiment with different warehouse parameters and observe their impact on the shortest path calculation, modify this file as needed.
